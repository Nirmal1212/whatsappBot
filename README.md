This repo contains the python files for scrapping Android Apps

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
This repo contains a ipython notebook for controlling a connected Android device. You can create macros and use it as a whatsapp bot for pre-defined functions

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
You need to run ipython notebook and load the androidBasicCommands file. Connect the android device, have the Android SDK ready so that adb is accessible.

* To be Updated
I haven't modularized the code and separated the whatsapp bot from the testing codes. Will be doing it in a while
